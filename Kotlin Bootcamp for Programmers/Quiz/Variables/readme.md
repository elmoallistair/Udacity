## Practice Time: Variables
1. Create a String variable rainbowColor, set its color value, then change it.
2. Create a variable blackColor whose value cannot be changed once assigned. Try changing it anyway.


### Solution Code
```
var rainbowColor = "red"
rainbowColor = "blue"
val blackColor = "black"
blackColor = "white" 	// Error
```
